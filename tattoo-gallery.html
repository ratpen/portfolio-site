 <p>Nathan Mendes<br>
half ink-stained fingers, half late-night thoughts<br>
tattoo artist who dreams in pixels, patterns, textures<br>
vintage PS2 wires in his soul, existential humor in his veins<br> <br>
he walks in between worlds, reality, imagination, and that weird space where ideas fight to exist<br>
sometimes messy, sometimes loud, always entirely himself <br> <br> <br>
I’ve been tattooing for a few years now, with a focus on clean linework, blackwork, and designs that sit somewhere between surreal and slightly broken.
<br> My style pulls a lot from early video games, not just visually, but in how they feel; glitchy, expressive, sometimes a bit cryptic.<br> <br> <br>

I like mixing that with absurd ideas, conceptual twists, and the kind of stuff that makes you look twice, even if you’re not sure why.<br> <br> <br>

Outside of tattooing, I’m also learning 3D art and figuring out ways to build spaces where weird ideas feel welcome. I’m into films, games, and music that do something different, or at least don’t try too hard to be cool. 
<br> <br> <br>If you’re into tattoos that are a little offbeat but still intentional, check out my flashes or send a message. I’m always down to collaborate on something unexpected.
